[![Tests](https://github.com/sylvaindecout/documentation-annotations/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sylvaindecout/documentation-annotations/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

You can check out [Cyril Martraire](https://twitter.com/cyriux) 's book, [Living Documentation: Continuous Knowledge Sharing by Design](http://informit.com/livingdoc), to understand better the general approach.
